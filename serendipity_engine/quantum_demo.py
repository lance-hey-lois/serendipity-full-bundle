Quantum Kernel Tie-Breaker (PennyLane-style demo)

This file shows how you *could* compute a small quantum kernel matrix
for top-K candidate embeddings (after PCA-encoded to small dims).
It is not executed here and assumes `pennylane` is installed.

Usage idea:
- Compress embeddings to 4-8 dims (e.g., PCA or random projection).
- Encode into a feature map circuit.
- Compute kernel entries K_ij = <phi(x_i)|phi(x_j)> via state overlaps.
- Use the kernel scores to break ties among top candidates.

Note: In production you'd batch small sets (e.g., K=16..64).
